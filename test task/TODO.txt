write simple C# avalonia app

to parse songs lists from wikipedia urls like:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playing_the_Angel

for html parsing to use HtmlAgilityPack
to output results into avalonia ListView

to output album name and
for each song to display:
Song name, Artist name, Writer(s), Duration
in separate column



BUGS THAT WERE NOT FIXED:
- if wikipedia table doesen't have "Total Length Row", last row of the table won't be included
- bad representation of writers data
- if wikipedia table has more than 4 columns( for example has "producers" column), data won't be presented properly.
- maybe possible to get a writer when he is not specified in a row, but didn't knew how to do it consistently because div which had that information, had no markings.
- overall bad code readability.
- didn't knew how to make ListView work, because everywhere it said that its unavailable in avalonia.
- no exceptions handled
